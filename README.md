This fun little project for custom [Devslopes](https://devslopes.com/)¬Æ platform Icons. All rights reserved to their respective owners of the themes I am using whether it is DC, Marvel, HBO, Netflix or any other app themes.

## How to Install

Copy the `.icns` file you'd like to use (`‚åò + C`). Find Devslopes in your Applications folder, right click the icon and select `Get Info`. Click the icon in the top right corner so that a blue highlight appears around it. `‚åò + V` to paste the new icon in. It may require a restart of Devslopes for the icon to take effect.

If that doesn't work, then dragging the `.icns` to the icon (in the top left) of the info pane, until you see the green plus sign and then dropping it works.

Hovering on them will reveal the names
